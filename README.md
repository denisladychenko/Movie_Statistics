# Movie_Statistics
program calculates mean, median, and mode of the values entered into the array

Write a program that can be used to gather statistical data about the number of movies college students see in the month. The program should ask the user how many students were serveyed and dynamically allocate an array of that size. The program should then allow the user to enter the number of movies each student has seen. The progam should then calculate the mean, median, and mode of the values entered.
